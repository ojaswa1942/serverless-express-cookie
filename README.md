# Netlify Serverless Express Cookies

This is a playground repository to test express and serverless using [Netlifyâ€™s Lambda Functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions). The repository experiments with: 

- Express server on Lambda
- Serving public static resources without S3
- Different cookie-loading test cases: Same setup is deployed on multiple domains for regressive testing.
- Test suites can also be managed using Google Tag Manager
